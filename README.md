About Me ðŸŒŸ
Hey there! I'm passionate about math and love coding, especially in JavaScript. It's like solving puzzles for me, but cooler because you can see what you've made right away! I want to work in a job that helps people and keeps me learning.

Experience ðŸš€
Web Design: Created visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.
Frontend Development: Built responsive landing pages using HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JS.
Code Quality: Committed to writing clean and maintainable code.
Collaboration: Worked independently and in teams using ReactJS, SASS (SCSS), TypeScript, and BEM.
Backend Development: Designed servers with Node.js and databases with Sequelize ORM.
API Development: Created CRUD endpoints for smooth server-database interaction.
React Development: Crafted information pages using React.
Project Management: Utilized Asana for project progress monitoring.
Coding Practice: Dedicated over 500 hours to honing coding skills.

Skills ðŸ’ª
Flexible: I can adapt to changes easily, like working different hours or handling new tasks.
Problem Solver: I'm good at figuring out why things go wrong and fixing them.
Empathetic: I understand other people's perspectives when I work with them.
Hardworking: I can handle lots of responsibilities at once. For example, I worked, studied, wrote a thesis, and did other projects all at the same time!
